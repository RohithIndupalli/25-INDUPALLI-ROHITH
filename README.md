Smart Student Time Management System using MERN & Agentic AI

This project is an Edu-Tech web application developed as a student-focused solution to help learners manage their academic workload effectively.
It uses the MERN stack along with an Agentic AI assistant to analyze assignments, deadlines, course schedules, and personal commitments to generate smart study plans and reminders.

 Problem Statement

Students often struggle with:

Managing multiple assignments and deadlines

Poor time planning

Academic stress due to overload

Forgetting important submissions

Traditional planners are static and require manual effort.
This project solves these issues by introducing an AI-powered assistant that thinks, plans, and adapts like a personal academic guide.

Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

To help students plan their academic schedules efficiently

To prioritize assignments based on urgency and workload

To automatically suggest optimal study times

To reduce academic stress using intelligent task management

To demonstrate the practical use of MERN + Agentic AI

 How the Agentic AI Works (Student View)

The AI assistant:

Collects student data (courses, deadlines, commitments)

Analyzes workload and time availability

Uses LangGraph to perform multi-step decision making

Suggests:

Study time slots

Task priority order

Deadline reminders

Re-adjusts plans when new tasks are added

This makes the system dynamic, unlike normal to-do apps.
