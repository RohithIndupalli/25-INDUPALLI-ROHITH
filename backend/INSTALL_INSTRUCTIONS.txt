INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

Since you're already in the backend directory with venv activated:

STEP 1: Install dependencies
-----------------------------
Run this command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt has been updated to let pip automatically resolve 
compatible versions, which should avoid dependency conflicts.

STEP 2: If step 1 fails
------------------------
Try installing packages directly (pip will resolve versions automatically):

    pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard] motor pymongo pydantic pydantic-settings langgraph langchain langchain-openai openai python-dotenv apscheduler python-multipart

STEP 3: Verify installation
----------------------------
Test if uvicorn is installed:

    python -c "import uvicorn; print('Success!')"

STEP 4: Run the server
-----------------------
Once installation is successful:

    python run.py

The server should start on http://localhost:8000

NOTE: Make sure your virtual environment is activated (you should see (venv) 
in your terminal prompt). If not activated:

    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
